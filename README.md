Assignment 9

Which Honeypot(s) you deployed:
Ubuntu â€“ Dionaea with HTTP

Any issues you encountered:
Issues I encountered were trouble setting up the firewall due to not have restarted my VM for awhile. Because I had been saving the state of the machine, the firewall command never worked. After multiple tries, I restarted the VM and eventually the command worked. Finally, I needed a lot of patience for this because creating the honeypot took more than 20 minutes and 2 hours of loading.
